I am an aspiring Computer Science and Human Computer Interaction researcher (HCI). I am currently completing my Bachelors degree at [BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/). My research interests lie in the intersection of HCI and Artificial Intelligence. I am also interested in responsible technology design and universal design. I have had the pleasure of working under [Professor Dipanjan](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/dipanjan/Profile) and [Professor Sameer Patil](https://faculty.utah.edu/u6038392-SAMEER_PATIL/contact/index.hml) as a research intern. 

I use this website to blog about my thoughts on certain papers, document some of my work and write articles on topics I find interesting. In my spare time I enjoy playing football, and gaming.
